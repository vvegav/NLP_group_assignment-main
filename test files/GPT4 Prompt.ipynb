    "news_summary = \"China's banks offer red envelopes to encourage retirement savings: China's banks are offering red envelopes filled with cash to customers who register for private-pension accounts, as part of a push to get citizens thinking about retirement. Under a law introduced last November, workers may set aside savings in tax-deferred accounts accessible upon retirement. Savers can deduct contributions from taxable income, pay no tax on capital gains, and only a 3% tax rate at the time of distribution. Concerns about the failing private pension system in China: Chinese workers retire young, as early as 50 for women and 60 for men. China's compulsory basic pension will be in deficit by 2028 and run out entirely by 2035. The value of China's private pensions is estimated to reach at least $1.7 trillion by 2025. However, the current pension system is facing challenges in getting people to save and invest their funds. Challenges and issues with China's pension system: Banks have struggled to get customers to actually save and invest in pension accounts. In March, fewer than one-third of accounts contained funds. Some of the problems facing the pension system include lack of awareness among workers, the perception of financial markets as risky, and limited investment options within China's domestic economy. The future outlook for China's private pension system: Pension pots in China cannot be invested offshore, limiting their ability to escape a weak domestic economy. The government is expected to raise the retirement age, further delaying when savers can gain access to their investments. The failing private pension system adds to the list of challenges for Chinese policymakers.\""
